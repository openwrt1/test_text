Some distro files are not public readable, so supermin cannot copy them
into the appliance.  This is a problem with your Linux distro.  Please ask
your distro to stop doing pointless security by obscurity.
You can ignore these warnings.  You *do not* need to use sudo.

commandrvf: mkfs.fat
Usage: mkfs.fat [OPTIONS] TARGET [BLOCKS]
Create FAT filesystem in TARGET, which can be a block device or file. Use only
up to BLOCKS 1024 byte blocks if specified. With the -C option, file TARGET will be
created with a size of 1024 bytes times BLOCKS, which must be specified.

Options:
  -a              Disable alignment of data structures
  -A              Toggle Atari variant of the filesystem
  -b SECTOR       Select SECTOR as location of the FAT32 backup boot sector
  -c              Check device for bad blocks before creating the filesystem
  -C              Create file TARGET then create filesystem in it
  -D NUMBER       Write BIOS drive number NUMBER to boot sector
  -f COUNT        Create COUNT file allocation tables
  -F SIZE         Select FAT size SIZE (12, 16 or 32)
  -g GEOM         Select disk geometry: heads/sectors_per_track
  -h NUMBER       Write hidden sectors NUMBER to boot sector
  -i VOLID        Set volume ID to VOLID (a 32 bit hexadecimal number)
  -I              Ignore and disable safety checks
  -l FILENAME     Read bad blocks list from FILENAME
  -m FILENAME     Replace default error message in boot block with contents of FILENAME
  -M TYPE         Set media type in boot sector to TYPE
  --mbr[=y|n|a]   Fill (fake) MBR table with one partition which spans whole disk
  -n LABEL        Set volume name to LABEL (up to 11 characters long)
  --codepage=N    use DOS codepage N to encode label (default: 850)
  -r COUNT        Make room for at least COUNT entries in the root directory
  -R COUNT        Set minimal number of reserved sectors to COUNT
  -s COUNT        Set number of sectors per cluster to COUNT
  -S SIZE         Select a sector size of SIZE (a power of two, at least 512)
  -v              Verbose execution
  --variant=TYPE  Select variant TYPE of filesystem (standard or Atari)

  --invariant     Use constants for randomly generated or time based values
  --offset=SECTOR Write the filesystem at a specific sector into the device file.
  --help          Show this help message and exit
